# Bilgi
**Eğitim Dili:** İngilizce

**Eğitmen:** Todd Birzer

**Organizasyon:** Udemy

# Notlar
Eğitimi, TUSAŞ'ın çalışanlarına sağladığı Udemy Business hesabı ile çevrim içi olarak aldım. Giriş seviyesinin biraz üzerinde bir eğitimdi bence. Temel, basit giriş bilgilerinin ötesinde, kendi deneyimlerini de sunuyordu eğitmen.
