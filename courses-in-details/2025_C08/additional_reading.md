[HBR] The Surprising Power of Questions

Much of an executive’s workday is spent asking others for information—requesting status updates from a team leader, for example, or questioning a counterpart in a tense negotiation. Yet unlike professionals such as litigators, journalists, and doctors, who are taught how to ask questions as an essential part of their training, few executives think of questioning as a skill that can be honed—or consider how their own answers to questions could make conversations more productive.

That’s a missed opportunity.

[HCMI] Top 5 Metrics

The following five key human capital metrics can help make sense out of the challenges and confusion of economic downturns and growth cycles. These metrics provide visibility to understand and analyze the workforce and enable data driven decision making for the workforce. In an economic crisis, organizations who use these key metrics would be much better prepared to handle the changes, move rapidly with agility, and make precise surgical cuts rather than taking an ineffective “cut across the board” approach.

[HBR] There’s No Such Thing as Big Data in HR

“Big data” has become such a ubiquitous phrase that every function of business now feels compelled to outline how they are going to use it to improve their operations. That’s also true for Human Resources (HR) departments, which is where most of a company’s money is spent, and where — we’d like to believe — the real value lies.
